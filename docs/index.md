# Tunnel Provider

The Tunnel provider is used to manage local network tunnels. This enables users to
securely access and manage remote servers (databases, web servers, etc.) in private
networks without needing to open additional ports to the outside networks.

The provider is compatible with HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP)

## Available tunnel types

- [AWS Systems Manager (SSM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/)
- [SSH Tunneling](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling)

## Example Usage

### Terraform >= 1.10

~> **Note:** For optimal compatiblity with HashiCorp Cloud Platform, use [Ephemeral Resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral).

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    tunnel = {
      source  = "dfns/tunnel"
      version = ">= 1.1.0"
    }
  }
}

ephemeral "tunnel_ssm" "eks" {
  target_host  = "https://eks-cluster.region.eks.amazonaws.com"
  target_port  = 443
  ssm_instance = "i-instanceid"
  ssm_region   = "us-east-1"
}

provider "kubernetes" {
  host = "https://${ephemeral.tunnel_ssm.eks.local_host}:${ephemeral.tunnel_ssm.eks.local_port}"

  tls_server_name = "eks-cluster.region.eks.amazonaws.com"

  client_certificate     = file("~/.kube/client-cert.pem")
  client_key             = file("~/.kube/client-key.pem")
  cluster_ca_certificate = file("~/.kube/cluster-ca-cert.pem")
}
```

### Terraform >= 1.0

```terraform
data "tunnel_ssm" "eks" {
  target_host  = "https://eks-cluster.region.eks.amazonaws.com"
  target_port  = 443
  ssm_instance = "i-instanceid"
  ssm_region   = "us-east-1"
}
```
